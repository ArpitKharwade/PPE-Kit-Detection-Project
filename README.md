# PPE Kit Detection using YOLO and OpenCV

This project aims to detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as helmets, vests, gloves, and masks using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, implemented with OpenCV in Python. It is designed to ensure compliance with safety standards in industrial and construction settings.

## Features
- Real-time detection of PPE items.
- Pre-trained YOLOv4/YOLOv5 models for efficient detection.
- Integration with OpenCV for image and video stream processing.
- Easy setup and usage with Python and VSCode.
